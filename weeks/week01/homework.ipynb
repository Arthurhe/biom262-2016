    "### Logging in off-campus\n",
    "\n",
    "For some reason TSCC isn't letting some people log on off-campus. To do that, you'll need to set up a VPN client following [these](https://blink.ucsd.edu/technology/network/connections/off-campus/VPN/index.html) instructions for the **VPN AnyConnect client**. Don't do EasyConnect because that will only send the traffic in your browser through UCSD, but you need all of the internetz through UCSD to be able to `ssh` and stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's up with this \"home\" directory anyway?\n",
    "\n",
    "There's been some confusion about what is a \"home\" directory. On TSCC, there is a folder called `/home`, but this is *not* **your** home directory. If you look at `/home`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ ls /home\n",

    "\n",
    "You'll see a bunch of usernames. The idea is that everyone has their own \"house,\" so your \"house\" is `/home/ucds-train##`, and this is called your \"home directory.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ahhh I did something I didn't want to do and want to get out!!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ran a program or command that you didn't want to, \"Ctrl-`C`\" is your friend. This will exit whatever program you're in and get you back to the command line. You can think of it as a \"AHH I don't know what happened and I'm scared please let me out!! Panic panic!\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add shortcuts to make logging in easier\n",
    "\n",
    "To help you log in to TSCC, for Mac: edit your `~/.bash_profile` (on Linux, edit your ``~/.bashrc`)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "nano ~/.bash_profile\n",

    "### Still getting asked for a password?\n",
    "\n",
    "This seems to be a problem exclusive to Mac OS X \"El Capitan\" users. It turns out that `ssh-add` is not permanent and you have to do it every time you want to log in. To avoid having to explicitly write that command, instead we'll edit the `~/.bash_profile` on your laptop.\n",

    "On your laptop, open up `~/.bash_profile` to edit using `nano`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Make sure the Anaconda installer *actually* added lines to your `~/.bashrc`\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `nano` to look at your `~/.bashrc` and edit it just in case:\n",

    "\n",
    "To get Jupyter notebook on your computer, you'll need to set up a \"SSH Tunnel\" that \"listens\" to that particular port. Follow [these](http://realprogrammers.com/how_to/set_up_an_ssh_tunnel_with_putty.html) instructions using the `####` port number that you created before.
