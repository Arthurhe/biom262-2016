    "We'll have a brief chalk-talk overview of what `git` is and how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a change (aka edit) to a file in your cloned repo and save the change locally. Try making a change to this README.md file by adding content to the bottom of it.\n",
    "2. Type `git status` in the terminal to see what's up. Type `git diff` to get a detailed list of differences. Use `j` and `k` to navigate up and down the diff, and `q` to end the diff.\n",
    "3. Type `git commit -am \"message for the commit\"` to create a new commit\n",
    "  - Look, `git` is teaching you life lessons like overcoming fear of commitment :)\n",
    "4. Type `git status` to see what's up.\n",
    "5. Type `git push` to push your changes up to the github server.\n",
    "6. If you made a change to the README.md file, you should see it changed on your fork's github page.\n",
    "7. Type `git branch` to list out the current local branches\n",
    "8. Type `git checkout -b newbranch` to create a new branch\n",
    "9. Make a commit onto the branch, and push the changes up to github.\n",
    "   Note: You will need to use the branch name in the push, e.g. if my branch is called `smallchange`, I would push via `git push origin smallchange`\n",
    "  - BONUS: Make a merge conflict! Make *another* branch and edit the `README.md` file. Now make **another** branch and edit the `README.md` file *on the same line*. Try to push both branches. You should get a merge conflict. This is good. See, git is teaching you yet another life lesson: dealing with conflict!\n",
    "10. You should see your new branch up on your fork's github page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's make a real contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can run the test suite by typing `py.test` (pronounced \"pie test\") in the repo's root directory. This is a python package that will execute the tests and print out the results.\n",
    "2. Open up the test file `tests/test_gitgoing.py` in your favorite editor\n",
    "3. Comment out the test named `test_cv_broken` by removing the # characters at the beginning of each line of the test in the `test_gitgoing.py` file.\n",
    "4. Run the tests again and watch it fail. You should see this kind of message:\n",

    "  - BONUS: Notice the `@pytest.fixture` \"decorator\" on the function `x_norm` (in Python, these things above functions are called decorators. If you're familiar with lambda calculus, they are closures). What does this do to the function?\n",
    "4. Use your new knowledge of `git` to fix the test!\n",
    "  1. Create a branch `git checkout -b myfixbringsalltheboystotheyard` \n",
    "  2. Fix the test by editing files, using Sublime text\n",
    "  3. Add and commit the changes `git commit -am \"fixed test_cv_broken\"`\n",
    "  4. Push to your new branch `git push origin myfixbringsalltheboystotheyard`\n",
    "5.  Run the tests again and watch it succeed.\n",
    "6. Create a pull request back to the original repo that you forked by going to \n",
    "   your `gitgoing` repo website (`github.com/yourgithubusername/gitgoing`),\n",
    "   and pressing the green \"compare\" button next to the branches, which looks \n",
    "   like this: ![](http://i.imgur.com/xKzb8v7.png)\n",
    "  - BONUS: Look at your contribution and the rest of your class! On the `gitgoing` github page, click where it says \"(N) Contributors\" which looks like this: ![](http://imgur.com/iGb1ank). Then click \"Network\" which will show you the literal graph network of everyone that has ever forked this repo and pushed any changes to github. Pretty cool!\n",
    "7. And that's how you contribute to open source software!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build the documentation\n",
    "A key part of any open source project is documenting it! The [sphinx](link) library makes it really easy to add documentation to a project, which you can then host for free on [github pages](link).\n",
    "\n",
    "We're currently doing that for this repository, you can see the documentation page [here](http://codeneuro.org/gitgoing)\n",
    "\n",
    "To see where the documentation comes from, you can build it yourself locally. If you've cloned this repository, just navigate to the `docs` folder, and then enter\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "sphinx-build -a . build\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a set of `.html` files in the folder `build`. If you go into that folder and double-click `index.html`, it should open in a web browser, and you'll see something that looks just like the webpage mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sphinx takes a little bit of configuration, but can automatically generate a page directly from your Python package, including the documentation you provide for your classes and methods. And you can regenerate the documentation whenever you change the code. This makes it easy to automatically document your project and keep the documentation up to date.\n",
