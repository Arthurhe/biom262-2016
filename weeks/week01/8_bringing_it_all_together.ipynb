    "To bring it all together, you will combine everything you've learned so far about UNIX, bash shell, TSCC, git, and github to collaboratively write a submitter script to TSCC.\n",

    "1. Identify your randomly assigned partner that was emailed out.\n",
    "2. Pick one person to be reponsible for exercises 1-3 from `6_tf_binding_promoters.ipynb` (person1) and the the other to be responsible for exercises 4-6 (person2)\n",
    "3. Have person1 create a GitHub repo called `biom262-hw1` and write a short `README.md` file\n",
    "4. Have person2 add a LICENSE file\n",
    "5. Collaboratively work on a submitter script called `tf_binding.sh` to TSCC which has all the `##PBS` flags shown in the TSCC Quick Start Guide below, and contribute the lines of code that you are responsible for. Use `git blame tf_binding.sh` to make sure person1 is to \"blame\" for exercises 1-3 and person2 is to \"blame\" for exercises 4-5. The \"blame\" of the remaining file doesn't matter.\n",
    "6. Your final repository should have three files:\n",
