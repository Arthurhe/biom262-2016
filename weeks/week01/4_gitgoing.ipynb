    "# Git and Github\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will...\n",
    "\n",
    "* Have a GitHub username\n",
    "* Forked and cloned a Github repo\n",
    "* Contributed to open source: Made a \"Pull Request\" to a public github project\n",
    "* Have a cheatsheet to store UNIX/Python/R/Bioinformatics commands that you find useful\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites (Windows only)\n",
    "\n",
    "On Windows, you will need to install git via [`git-extensions`](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/).\n",
    "\n",
    "* * *\n",
    "\n",
    "## Create a GitHub username\n",
    "\n",
    "Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and create a username and password that is easy for you to type. For the rest of this exercise, you will need to be logged in to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## My first git repo\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we will be using this [cheatsheets](https://github.com/biom262/cheatsheets/) repository (\"repo\" for short) to learn `git`. Click on that link and click \"Fork\" (upper right). This will create your very own copy of these files. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, in your terminal, navigate to your home folder and create a directory where you will keep ALL your github repositories (usually a folder in your home directory like `~/code` or `~/software` or `~/workspace-git` or `~/git-repos`). hint: `mkdir`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clone (make a local copy onto your computer) of your cheatsheets repo from GitHub (the \"remote copy\") with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/username/cheatsheets.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now move into that directory (hint: `cd`) and make sure what you see (hint: `ls`) in the terminal is the same as what you see on the GitHub website.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's learn Git\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll have a brief chalk-talk overview of what `git` is and how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a change (aka edit) to a file in your cloned repo and save the change locally. For example, you could add a UNIX command that you learned that was particularly helpful.\n",
    "2. Type `git status` in the terminal to see what's up. Type `git diff` to get a detailed list of differences. Use `j` and `k` to navigate up and down the diff, and `q` to end the diff.\n",
    "3. Type `git commit -am \"message for the commit\"` to create a new commit\n",
    "  - Look, `git` is teaching you life lessons like overcoming fear of commitment :)\n",
    "4. Type `git status` to see what's up.\n",
    "5. Type `git push` to push your changes up to the github server.\n",
    "6. If you made a change to the README.md file, you should see it changed on your fork's github page.\n",
    "7. Type `git branch` to list out the current local branches\n",
    "8. Type `git checkout -b newbranch` to create a new branch\n",
    "9. Make a commit onto the branch, and push the changes up to github.\n",
    "   Note: You will need to use the branch name in the push, e.g. if my branch is called `smallchange`, I would push via `git push origin smallchange`\n",
    "  - BONUS: Make a merge conflict! Make *another* branch and edit the `README.md` file. Now make **another** branch and edit the `README.md` file *on the same line*. Try to push both branches. You should get a merge conflict. This is good. See, git is teaching you yet another life lesson: dealing with conflict!\n",
    "10. You should see your new branch up on your fork's github page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's push our changes upstream\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use your branch from the previous section to add onto the `cheatsheets` page. If you don't like that change, feel free to make a different one on a new branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a pull request back to the original repo that you forked by going to \n",
    "   your `cheatsheets` repo website (`http://github.com/username/cheatsheets`),\n",
    "   and pressing the green \"compare\" button next to the branches, which looks \n",
    "   like this: ![](http://i.imgur.com/xKzb8v7.png)\n",
    "  - BONUS: Look at your contribution and the rest of your class! On the [`biom262/cheatsheets`](https://github.com/biom262/cheatsheets) page, click where it says \"(##) Contributors\" (where ## is some number). Then click \"Network\" which will show you the literal graph network of everyone that has ever forked this repo and pushed any changes to github. Pretty cool!\n",
    "2. And that's how you contribute to open source software! Wasn't that easy?\n",
    "\n",
    "## You're done!\n",
